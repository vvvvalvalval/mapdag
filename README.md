# mapdag

A library for expressing computations as graphs of named steps, with dependencies between them.

More concretely, the computations are modeled as a Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) of named steps, represented as maps. Computation is performed by supplying inputs in a map, and returns the requested outputs in a map, hence the name `mapdag`.
